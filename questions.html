<p><strong>Answer: </strong>There are many poossible answers for the question depending upon the situation. My anwer to the email could be as follows</p>
<p>Dear Mr.... (Or Mrs____)<br />Thank you very much for your inquiry. Our app does not offer live image previews at present. However, It is one of many exciting features that we are going to introduce in the coming upgrade of our product. the upgdeade will be free for our existing customers. <br />If having live image previews are extreemly important for you right now, you may switch to Product customizer but if you can wait for a while, I promise you will have a great many features, including live image preview, for free, just in a couple of months time.<br />I, myself will make sure that you get the upgrade on priority.<br />Let me know if you have any additional questions and I&rsquo;ll be glad to help!<br />Regards,<br />Salah</p>
<p><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong>Imagine you&rsquo;ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />I will take the following steps<br />1) I will check all emails and understand what the problem is. If all customers are facing the same problem then ofcourse there will be same solution for each of them. If not then it will be a different scenatrio.<br />2) I will contact my technical team and send them emergency alert and I will update them with the comlains I received.<br />3) I will update the customer support page with a notification about the problem that customers are facing. If possible I will write down an estimated time required by the technical team so solve the issue.<br />4) In case of serious issue, will send an email to affected customers with an apology, estimated time for resolution and a link to the status page.<br />5) Once the problem is resolved, I will update the status page and send email to customers informing them of the solution and thanking them for their patience.<br />6) If allowed I will offer them remedy in terms of let's say free technical service in future etc.</p>
